# Fitness Planner

_Disclaimer: Do not attempt any fitness program without medical
clearance from a credentialed authority who is licensed, bonded and

Here is a simple spreadsheet to plan your cardio-respiratory fitness
ramp-up from your current pathetic condition to that of a
fully-trained athlete.  And it only takes six months!  All you need is
some discipline, some gear and some math.  And this spreadsheet does the
math for you.

## 1. Take your pulse at rest

In the morning, after you awake, but before you arise, measure your
pulse in BPM.  You might want to measure it more than once for
accuracy.

## Enter your details into the spreadsheet

Put in your date-of-birth, your resting heart rate and the day you
want to start your program.  Your schedule will be shown complete.

## Stick to the program.

On each exercise day in the chart, enter the target heart rate on the chart into
your computerized cardio equipment, and set the workout-time to the time on
the chart.  You can print out the chart and keep it in your gym.
There are columns on the chart for you to record the actual dates and
parameters of each entry's workout.
